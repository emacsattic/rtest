  <Component Name="rtest-grade-by-comparand">
    rtest-maybe-make-single-failure's object should be (result
    grader), when we do multiple objects.
  </Component>
  <Component Name="rtest-grade-by-predicate">
    Does not take notice of bindings, assumes exactly one arg.
  </Component>
  <Component Name="rtest-map-graders">
    We'd like this to work for vectors too, but it doesn't.  We'd
    change to `across result' and change the earlier test on result to
    `sequencep'.  Graders must still be a list.

  </Component>
  <Component Name="rtest-grade-every">
    We'd like this to work for vectors too.  As for rtest-map-graders,
    use across, sequencep, etc.

  </Component>
  <Component Name="pattern-destr-build-call-to-grader">
    Could check if there are any duplicate symbols and report if so.

    We'd like to show the bound syms / vals too, when this
    can show multiple objects and their symbols.  
  </Component>
  <Component Name="rtest-grader-func-alist-1">
    Common Lisp requires the load-time work here, so don't change this
    to a quoted list.
