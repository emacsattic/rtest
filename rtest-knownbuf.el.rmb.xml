  <Component Name="rtest-knownbuf-acquire-buffer">
    Should the buffer's base name be a named constant?  No, that adds
    nothing.  Using a named symbol is just like using a name.

    Should the buffer's name begin with a space, thereby not showing
    up in the buffer list?  No, because the user may want to examine
    the buffer to see what happens when the test is failing.
