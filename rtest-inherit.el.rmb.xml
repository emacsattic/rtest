    For probe-builders, returning an error is a little bit tangled-up.
    Somethimes we'd like to report a real error, sometimes just skip the
    ones that won't behave.  The catcher can manage that by
    distinguishing rtest-cant-inherit from other errors.  

    And the pattern-binder, which would be useful to construct
    inheritances, has to manage throwing back errors.  IE, we'll need
    another relative of pattern-bind that knows when it has missed,
    using pat-r-combine-patternforms-maybe-throw

    This can't easily combine with rtest-make-inheriting-closure, Even
    tho all this does is get passed to rtest-make-inheriting-closure, it
    has to be independent because the regular probe loop expects it to
    be.
