rtest is derived from Wayne Mesard's regress.el package, a few
versions back.

Even tho I wrote almost all of the code (98%+) in the current rtest
package and redesigned it heavily, I believe this package owes a great
debt to Wayne.

If regress.el had been as ambitious as rtest is, it prolly never would
have got off the ground.  But regress.el had a good idea, an idea so
strong that it took on a life of its own.

Every step of the way, I used regress.el or some direct descendant of
it to check my work.

So I want to thank Wayne and acknowledge that he started this project.
