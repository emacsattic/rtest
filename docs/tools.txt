In ancillary/safe-equal.el there is a variant of equal that is
sometimes very useful.  `safe-equal' can compare circular structures,
whereas ordinary `equal' goes into an infinite loop.

rtest-load-only-suites is useful for testing after you have compiled
the file the tests are in.  Simply visit that file and call
rtest-load-only-suites and the tests (and everything else inside
eval-when-compile) will be loaded.

Unfortunately Lisp offers no way to manage tets as such, so it has to
be done manually.
