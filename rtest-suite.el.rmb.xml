  <Component Name="rtest-fail-summary-p">
    This doesn't work in CLISP because typep doesn't work properly in
    CLISP.  We could use rtest-any-valid-return-p instead but that
    doesn't work in Elisp.  So I bandaged it in rtest-lisp.lisp, but
    the real fix is to use a better inferior Lisp.

  <Component Name="rtest-unflag-symbol">
    Not quite an entry point, but usable.  rtest-entry.el and
    rtest-cl-entry would manage this if it were to become frequently
    used.

    This can't have an interactive spec to acquire the symbol because
    it services Common Lisp too.
