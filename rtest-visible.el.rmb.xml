    The failure report structures are lists, so we can pass them
    between Elisp and Common Lisp, and they are named so that we can
    tell them apart.  But now that we format the report before passing
    it back, perhaps they needn't be lists any more.  This could
    incidentally work around CLisp's typep problems.

    This could add something indicating list, vector/array, or
    structure.

    :type could theoretically also use `nil' but that would mean no
    error, which contradicts the fact that it's an error report.
